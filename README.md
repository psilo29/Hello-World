# Hello-World
I'm a complete noob at this. I have no computer science background. No coding experience. Harambe was a hero.
I've always been intrigued and fascinated with computer technology. The issue I've always ran into was that I never had the opportunity to nurture this desire to explore this curiousity. 
Now as an adult who is able to be more intentional with the way he spends his time, I am venturing into worlds unfamiliar, that in the past I've found so intimidating that I simply defeated myself without even trying.
Looking around at what's already out there in the world, one can't help but feel as though I will forever be playing catch up.
However, I am slowly but surely getting better at accepting my shortcomings and simply maintaining an open mind so that I can absorb as much as I can.
